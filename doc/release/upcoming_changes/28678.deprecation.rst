* ``arr.T`` property has been deprecated for array scalars and arrays with dimensionality
  different than ``2`` to be compatible with the Array API standard. To achieve the same
  behavior when ``arr.ndim != 2``, either ``np.permute_dims(arr, range(arr.ndim)[::-1])``
  (also compatible with the Array API) or ``arr.transpose()`` can be used.
