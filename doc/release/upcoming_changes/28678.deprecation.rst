* ``arr.T`` property has been deprecated for array scalars and arrays with dimensionality
  different than ``2`` to be compatible with the Array API standard. To achieve similar
  behavior when ``arr.ndim != 2``, either ``arr.transpose()``, or ``arr.mT`` (swaps
  the last two axes only), or ``np.permute_dims(arr, range(arr.ndim)[::-1])`` (compatible
  with the Array API) can be used.
